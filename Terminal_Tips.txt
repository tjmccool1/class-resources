================================= TERMINAL / COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI)

-- Intro --

Everything in your filesystem is either a file or a directory (a container for files)

Your file system is organized in a tree-like structure:

                       / (root directory)/

                             |
                             |

                           Users/

                             |
                             |

    JustinReich (or your username) navigate to this level using ~

                        |           |
                        |           |

               Applications/       Desktop/   Etc...

            |               |          |
            |               |          |
