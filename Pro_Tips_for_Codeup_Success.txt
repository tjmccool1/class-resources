================================= STRONGLY ENCOURAGED CONDUCT

    - BE HEARD; BE SEEN! If you are struggling, don't struggle alone!
    - Ask questions, with a strong voice!
    - Feel free to experiment during lectures
    - Don't get too focused on taking tons of notes; JUST CODE
    - If you feel overwelmed or frusterated, consider taking a break!
    - Please step out at any point if you need to make a call or take a break

Outside Class...
    - "Play" with code (especially with concepts that are shaky)
    - Go to Geekdom and tech meetups regularly
    - Read (slightly) ahead in the curriculum
    - Explore and study additional resources (majority of study should involve YOU coding!)
    - Work on larger projects with other students or on your own
