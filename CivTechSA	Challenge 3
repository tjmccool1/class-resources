CivTechSA	Challenge 3

Department: 
	Center City Development and Operations (CCDO)

Project Name: 
	One pass transportation program for downtown

Description: 	
	The Center City Development and Operations Department facilitates and initiates the development and redevelopment of neighborhoods, businesses and cultural resources within the Greater Downtown Area â€“ an area that is well positioned for residential growth and for mixed-use development. San Antonio is currently experiencing a large amount of economic growth in its downtown area. San Antonio is projected to have more than 7,500 housing units in the downtown area by 2020 and has the top 2 most visited attractions in Texas: the River Walk and the Alamo. Three of the more popular modes of transportation include: Bcycle (SA Bike Share), VIA Metropolitan Transit and the River Barges (Go Rio San Antonio River Cruises shuttle/taxi service). Currently, all three transportation modes operate independently from each other, requiring an individual to purchase separate tickets or passes. CCDO has partnered with these entities to develop a solution so residents, locals and tourists can have a single pass that allows use of all three options for one fee.

Technology Need:
	 CCDO seeks a solution that will provide residents and visitors a single pass that allows use of all three options for one fee.
