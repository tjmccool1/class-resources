QUESTION 1
You have a list/array of strings that represent dates and looks like this:
[‘Oct 7, 2009’, ‘Nov 10, 2009’, ‘Jan 10, 2009’, ‘Oct 22, 2009’, …]

The month is always the first three characters of full month name
(‘January’ => ‘Jan’, ‘February’ => ‘Feb’, …).

The day is one or two digits (1, 2, … 31), with no preceding zero. There is always a comma after the day. The year is always four digits. Write a routine (in any language) that will order this list of strings in date descending order. Do not use any built in date- ‐parsing library… write your own specific to this date format. Feel free to use, or not use, regex.

QUESTION 2
What are some ways to improve the security of a Unix/Linux system? Include general security guidelines and any specifics related to web servers and db servers.

QUESTION 3
With the test data below, fill in the “???” in the recursive CTE query so that each item in category table is listed with its parents.
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/queries- ‐with.html
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/functions- ‐array.html

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE category (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES category(id) DEFERRABLE,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED;
INSERT INTO category VALUES (1, NULL, 'animal');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (2, NULL, 'mineral');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (3, NULL, 'vegetable');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (4, 1, 'dog');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (5, 1, 'cat');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (6, 4, 'doberman');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (7, 4, 'dachshund');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (8, 3, 'carrot');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (9, 3, 'lettuce');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (10, 11, 'paradox1');
INSERT INTO category VALUES (11, 10, 'paradox2');
SELECT setval('category_id_seq', (select max(id) from category));
WITH RECURSIVE last_run(parent_id, id_list, name_list) AS (
???
SELECT id_list, name_list FROM last_run
???
WHERE
ORDER BY id_list;
ROLLBACK;
The output should look like this. The id_list column should be an integer array containing ARRAY[id, parent id, grandparent id, etc]. The name_list column should be a text field containing comma separated names.

id_list |       name_list        
---------+------------------------
{1}     | animal
{2}     | mineral
{3}     | vegetable
{4,1}   | dog, animal
{5,1}   | cat, animal
{6,4,1} | doberman, dog, animal
{7,4,1} | dachshund, dog, animal
{8,3}   | carrot, vegetable
{9,3}   | lettuce, vegetable
{10,11} | paradox1, paradox2
{11,10} | paradox2, paradox1
QUESTION 4
Using HTML5/CSS 3 techniques make a 100 x 100px red square that rotates via an animation 90 degrees when you click on it. You’re allowed to use a small amount of javascript but most of the animation/rotation should be accomplished using HTML5/CSS3. Include a list of which browsers it works on.
